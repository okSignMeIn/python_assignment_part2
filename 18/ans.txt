Azure Files:

Provides shared file storage using the SMB protocol.
Suitable for applications that require shared file access, such as traditional file-based applications or application configurations.
Can be mounted as a network drive on Windows and Linux systems.
Supports directory structures, file permissions, and access control lists (ACLs) like a traditional file system.
Supports snapshots for point-in-time backups of file shares.

Azure Blobs:

Provides object storage suitable for unstructured data like documents, images, videos, and backups.
Offers three types of blobs: block blobs, append blobs, and page blobs.
Does not expose file system semantics like directories or hierarchical structures.
Ideal for large-scale data storage, data lakes, and scenarios where data is ingested, processed, and analyzed in batch or stream.
Supports different access tiers to optimize costs based on data usage patterns.
